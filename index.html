				<h2> What is Biotechnology?</h2>
				<p> Biotechnology is technology that utilizes biological systems, living organisms or parts of this to develop or create different products.Brewing and baking bread are examples of processes that fall within the concept of biotechnology (use of yeast (= living organism) to produce the desired product). Such traditional processes usually utilize the living organisms in their natural form (or further developed by breeding), while the more modern form of biotechnology will generally involve a more advanced modification of the biological system or organism. </p>

					<h2> Everyday Stuff Developed by NASA </h2>
					
					<p>With the development of genetic engineering in the 1970s, research in biotechnology (and other related areas such as medicine, biology etc.) developed rapidly because of the new possibility to make changes in the organisms' genetic material (DNA).Today, biotechnology covers many different disciplines (eg. genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, etc.).</p>
